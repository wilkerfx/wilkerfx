<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Wilker Flores</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Computer Programmer from planet earth</h3>


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [BIODEV](https://biodev.herokuapp.com/)


As an Information Technology professional, I have extensive experience in various areas of the industry. Since the late 90s, I have been dedicated to the study of information technologies and have worked in different companies and areas since 2006, which has provided me with valuable skills to manage, deal with, and solve different challenges.

I began my career by participating in the first post-war election process in Angola, a large-scale project that involved many resources and the implementation of advanced technologies. I contributed my services, stood out, and grew professionally in this project, helping in the social development of my country.

In addition to technology, I have had the opportunity to work in other areas such as teaching, as a teacher in a private school, and in activities related to arts and music events. However, currently, my focus is on the business world as co-founder and CEO of a company focused on research and development of artificial intelligence and other technologies.

With a clear vision of the future, I am determined to create a company that stands out for its culture, quality, and technological innovation, a company that has a positive impact and excellent satisfaction for our customers and the world.

I hope that my company will be successful and prosperous, growing to a scale that allows us to contribute significantly to society and to those who use our products.

I am open to connections and partnerships that can help us achieve our growth and innovation goals. Together, we can explore new opportunities and create a bright future for technology in the world and beyond.

In summary, I am an experienced and motivated IT professional, determined to contribute to the development of my country and the world through technological innovation. I look forward to connecting with people who share this same passion and together building a bright future.
